> **GCL delegation**: GCL execution is delegated to `alicloud-gcl-runner-ops` (shared skill).

## 1. Generator Prompt Template

| `{{recent_executions}}` | R2 `memory_preflight.py` (Layer 1) | Recent PASS/FAIL for this operation |
| `{{known_traps}}` | R2 `memory_preflight.py` (Layer 2) | Known failure patterns — do not repeat |
| `{{strategy_hints}}` | R2 `memory_preflight.py` (Layer 3) | Weekly strategy hints (read-only) |
| `{{success_patterns}}` | R2 `memory_preflight.py` (Layer 2+) | Hard-won PASS patterns — prefer when applicable |

# Proven approaches (hard-won success patterns — prefer when applicable)
{{success_patterns}}

# Recent executions for this operation (Layer 1)

# ASK GCL Prompt Templates (Phase 5 — recommended)

## Generator/ Critic

Inherits ACK patterns (see `alicloud-ack-ops/references/prompt-templates.md`).
Key ASK-specifics:

- `DeleteCluster`: only destructive op. MUST backup kubeconfig.
- `DeletionProtection` gate: if the cluster has `deletion_protection=true`,
  the Generator MUST first call `ModifyCluster --DeletionProtection false`.
- Critic: independently re-query `DescribeClusterDetail` to verify cluster
  is absent AND `DeletionProtection` was toggled if applicable.
- Critic test assessment (accuracy over coverage): ask whether existing tests
  would fail if this change broke; require targeted regression (AGENTS.md §11.1)
  when ambiguous — not coverage padding.

## GCL Critic — Test & Regression Assessment (MANDATORY)

> **Accuracy over coverage** ([`AGENTS.md` §12](../../AGENTS.md#critic-test--regression-assessment-mandatory)) — applies to **every** Critic template in this file. Canonical block: [`docs/gcl-critic-test-assessment-block.md`](../../docs/gcl-critic-test-assessment-block.md).

On each critique, the Critic MUST also evaluate:

| Assessment | On failure |
|------------|------------|
| **Test accuracy** — would existing tests fail if this change broke? | `blocking=true`; concrete test fixes in `suggestions`; **RETRY** |
| **Regression gate** — is targeted regression ([§11.1](../../AGENTS.md#111-regression-testing-mandatory)) required? | Name smallest accurate suite(s) + require green-run evidence; or document zero-behavioral-delta skip rationale |

**Banned**: padding test count, chasing coverage %, PASSing because suites are green but no test asserts the changed behavior.

When returning strict JSON, include `test_assessment` and set `blocking=true` if `tests_accurate=false` or `regression_required=true` without green-run evidence in trace/summary.
